# Hardware Requirements

This course requires specific hardware to fully engage with the practical aspects of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Below is a list of recommended and required equipment:

## Required Hardware

*   **NVIDIA RTX GPU**: A powerful NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 30 series or higher) is essential for running complex simulations, training deep learning models, and accelerating various computational tasks. This is crucial for topics involving computer vision, reinforcement learning, and advanced control.
*   **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**: A compact and powerful AI supercomputer for edge devices. This platform will be used for deploying and testing AI models directly on robotic hardware, focusing on low-latency inference and real-time operations.
*   **Intel RealSense D435i**: A stereo depth camera with an integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). This sensor is vital for perception tasks, including 3D reconstruction, object detection, and localization, providing both depth and visual data.

## Recommended Hardware (for advanced projects)

*   **Unitree Robots (Go1, Go2, A1, B1)**: Access to Unitree quadruped robots is highly recommended for hands-on experience with advanced locomotion, control, and reinforcement learning in dynamic environments. While not strictly required for all exercises, these platforms offer invaluable practical insights into humanoid and quadrupedal robotics.
