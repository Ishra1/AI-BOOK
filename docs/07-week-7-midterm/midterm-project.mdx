# Midterm Project

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Apply ROS2 concepts to develop a basic robot application.
- Integrate sensor data for simple robot perception.
- Implement a foundational control strategy for a robotic system.
- Demonstrate problem-solving skills in a simulated robotics environment.

## Assessment Description

The midterm project is designed to assess your understanding and practical application of the concepts covered in Weeks 1 through 6. You will be tasked with developing a small, simulated robotics application using ROS2.

**Project Goal**: Create a ROS2-based robot application in a simulated environment (e.g., Gazebo) that can perform a specific task, such as:
1.  **Simple Navigation**: Program a differential drive robot to navigate a known, static environment from a starting point to a target goal.
2.  **Object Interaction**: Develop a manipulator robot to pick and place a simple object within a defined workspace.

## Requirements

*   **ROS2 Implementation**: All code must be written in Python/rclpy and utilize ROS2 nodes, topics, and services.
*   **Simulation**: The project must run within a Gazebo simulation environment.
*   **Documentation**: A brief report (approx. 2-3 pages) outlining your design choices, implementation details, and challenges faced.
*   **Demonstration**: A short video (3-5 minutes) demonstrating the functionality of your robot application.

## Deliverables

1.  ROS2 Workspace (including your package with all source code).
2.  Project Report (PDF).
3.  Demonstration Video (MP4).

## Evaluation Criteria

*   **Functionality**: Does the robot perform the task as specified?
*   **Code Quality**: Readability, modularity, and adherence to ROS2 best practices.
*   **Technical Understanding**: Demonstrated understanding of ROS2 concepts and robotic principles.
*   **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of the project report.

## Submission
Details regarding submission platform and deadline will be provided in a separate announcement.
