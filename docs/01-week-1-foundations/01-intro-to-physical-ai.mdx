# Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and its relationship to robotics.
- Identify key components of a physical AI system.
- Understand the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI.
- Differentiate between traditional AI and Physical AI (Russell & Norvig, 2010).

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional Artificial Intelligence, which often operates purely in digital or simulated environments, Physical AI embodies its intelligence in a physical form, typically a robot. This embodiment allows AI to perceive, act, and learn within real-world constraints and complexities (Brooks, 1991).

The field integrates concepts from various disciplines, including robotics, computer vision, machine learning, control theory, and cognitive science. The goal is to create autonomous agents that can perform tasks, adapt to changing environments, and collaborate with humans in real-world scenarios.

## Key Components of a Physical AI System

A typical Physical AI system comprises several interconnected components:

1.  **Perception**: Sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, microphones) gather data from the environment. This data is then processed to build an understanding of the surroundings.
2.  **Cognition/Reasoning**: AI algorithms process perceived data, make decisions, plan actions, and learn from experience. This often involves machine learning models, planning algorithms, and knowledge representation.
3.  **Action/Manipulation**: Actuators (e.g., motors, grippers) execute the decisions made by the cognitive system, allowing the robot to move, manipulate objects, or interact with its environment.
4.  **Communication**: Interaction with humans or other AI systems, often through natural language processing or visual cues.

## Differentiating Physical AI from Traditional AI

Traditional AI primarily focuses on tasks within virtual domains, such as game playing, data analysis, or natural language understanding. While these systems can achieve superhuman performance in their respective domains, they lack the ability to directly interact with the physical world.

Physical AI, on the other hand, deals with the challenges of embodiment. This includes dealing with sensor noise, actuator limitations, real-time constraints, and the unpredictable nature of physical environments. The situatedness and embodiment of Physical AI systems lead to different approaches in learning and control (Pfeifer & Scheier, 1999).

```python
# Example: Simple Python snippet for a hypothetical robot movement
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.position = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] # x, y, z

    def move_forward(self, distance):
        print(f"{self.name} moving forward by {distance} units.")
        self.position[0] += distance

    def get_position(self):
        return self.position

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_robot = Robot("Robo-1")
    print(f"Initial position: {my_robot.get_position()}")
    my_robot.move_forward(1.5)
    print(f"New position: {my_robot.get_position()}")
```
