## Module 1: Introduction to Control Systems and PID

### What is Control?
Content for: Definition and importance in robotics. Examples: Maintaining speed, position, balance.

### Open-Loop vs. Closed-Loop Control
Content for: **Open-Loop:** Definition, examples (e.g., timed actions), limitations. **Closed-Loop (Feedback):** Definition, block diagram, benefits (accuracy, disturbance rejection).

### Introduction to PID Control
Content for: Why PID? Overcoming limitations of simpler controllers. Brief overview of Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms. Historical context and widespread use.

## Module 2: Understanding the PID Components

### The Proportional (P) Term
Content for: **Concept:** Response proportional to the current error. **Equation:** `P_out = Kp * error`. **Effect on System:** Reduces steady-state error, increases responsiveness, can cause overshoot/oscillation. **`Kp` Gain:** Impact of increasing/decreasing `Kp`. **Limitations:** Always has a steady-state error (offset) for constant disturbances in simple systems.

### The Integral (I) Term
Content for: **Concept:** Response proportional to the accumulation of past errors. **Equation:** `I_out = Ki * ∫ error dt`. **Effect on System:** Eliminates steady-state error (offset), can lead to overshoot and slower response. **`Ki` Gain:** Impact of increasing/decreasing `Ki`. **Challenges:** Integral windup and anti-windup strategies.

### The Derivative (D) Term
Content for: **Concept:** Response proportional to the rate of change of the error. **Equation:** `D_out = Kd * (d(error)/dt)`. **Effect on System:** Dampens oscillations, improves stability, reduces overshoot, anticipates future error. **`Kd` Gain:** Impact of increasing/decreasing `Kd`. **Challenges:** Noise amplification. Filtering derivative term.

## Module 3: Constructing and Implementing the PID Controller

### The PID Equation
Content for: Combining P, I, and D terms: `Control_Output = Kp * error + Ki * ∫ error dt + Kd * (d(error)/dt)`. Discrete vs. Continuous implementation.
