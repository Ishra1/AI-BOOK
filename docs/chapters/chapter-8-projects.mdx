# Chapter 8 - Projects

## Section 1: Midterm Project

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Apply ROS2 concepts to develop a basic robot application.
- Integrate sensor data for simple robot perception.
- Implement a foundational control strategy for a robotic system.
- Demonstrate problem-solving skills in a simulated robotics environment.

### Assessment Description

The midterm project is designed to assess your understanding and practical application of the concepts covered in Weeks 1 through 6. You will be tasked with developing a small, simulated robotics application using ROS2.

**Project Goal**: Create a ROS2-based robot application in a simulated environment (e.g., Gazebo) that can perform a specific task, such as:
1.  **Simple Navigation**: Program a differential drive robot to navigate a known, static environment from a starting point to a target goal.
2.  **Object Interaction**: Develop a manipulator robot to pick and place a simple object within a defined workspace.

### Requirements

*   **ROS2 Implementation**: All code must be written in Python/rclpy and utilize ROS2 nodes, topics, and services.
*   **Simulation**: The project must run within a Gazebo simulation environment.
*   **Documentation**: A brief report (approx. 2-3 pages) outlining your design choices, implementation details, and challenges faced.
*   **Demonstration**: A short video (3-5 minutes) demonstrating the functionality of your robot application.

### Deliverables

1.  ROS2 Workspace (including your package with all source code).
2.  Project Report (PDF).
3.  Demonstration Video (MP4).

### Evaluation Criteria

*   **Functionality**: Does the robot perform the task as specified?
*   **Code Quality**: Readability, modularity, and adherence to ROS2 best practices.
*   **Technical Understanding**: Demonstrated understanding of ROS2 concepts and robotic principles.
*   **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of the project report.

### Submission
Details regarding submission platform and deadline will be provided in a separate announcement.

### 3. Project Goal and Objectives
The goal of this final project is to provide students with an opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired in this course to design, implement, and evaluate a robotic system or a significant component thereof. Projects can range from novel robotic applications, improved control algorithms, advanced perception systems, or exploration of human-robot interaction.

#### Objectives:
*   To identify a relevant problem in robotics and propose a creative solution.
*   To design and implement a robotic system (hardware, software, or both) that addresses the identified problem.
*   To critically evaluate the performance and limitations of the implemented system.
*   To effectively communicate technical information through written reports and oral presentations.
*   To work collaboratively (if applicable) in a team environment.

### 4. Learning Outcomes Addressed
Upon successful completion of this project, students will be able to:
*   Formulate a robotic problem and define its scope.
*   Select and apply appropriate robotic principles, algorithms, and tools.
*   Design and implement complex software and/or hardware systems for robotics.
*   Test, debug, and validate robotic system performance.
*   Analyze and interpret experimental results.
*   Present technical findings clearly and professionally.

### 5. Project Description Guidelines
Students will select or propose a project related to the course material. Projects may involve, but are not limited to:
*   **Robot Control:** Implementing advanced control strategies (e.g., adaptive, optimal, learning-based) for manipulators, mobile robots, or drones.
*   **Robot Perception:** Developing vision, LiDAR, or other sensor-based perception systems for object recognition, localization, mapping (SLAM), or scene understanding.
*   **Path Planning & Navigation:** Creating algorithms for autonomous navigation in complex environments, motion planning for manipulators, or multi-robot coordination.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Designing interfaces or control schemes for intuitive human interaction, collaborative robotics, or teleoperation.
*   **Robotic Applications:** Developing a robot for a specific application (e.g., assistive robotics, agricultural robotics, inspection, education).

Projects can be purely simulation-based, involve physical hardware, or a combination of both.
