# Research Paper on AI‑Native Software Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy Through Primary Sources
Every technical or research‑based claim must be directly verified using primary sources (e.g. official documentation, foundational papers, or authoritative research).

### Academic Clarity
All written content must be clear, structured, and logically presented, targeting an audience with a computer‑science background.

### Reproducibility Mandate
Every claim in the research paper must be traceable, cited appropriately, and independently verifiable.

### Scientific Rigor
Peer‑reviewed academic literature must be given highest priority. Speculation is not allowed without appropriate citation.

## Standards of Compliance
### A. Citation Rules
- Use APA style for citations (American Psychological Association).
- All factual and technical claims must be supported by sources.
- At least 50% of sources must come from peer‑reviewed journals or conference papers.

### B. Integrity Requirements
- Zero tolerance for plagiarism.
- All paraphrasing must be proper and accurate.
- Every external idea must be credited.

### C. Writing Quality Requirements
- Readability level: roughly equivalent to Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 10–12.
- Writing must be concise, academic, and non-redundant.

## Document Constraints
- Length: **5,000–7,000 words**.
- Minimum **15 authoritative sources**.
- Final deliverable format: PDF with embedded APA citations.
- Any figures or tables must be properly captioned and referenced.

## Success Criteria
- All claims must be fact-verified against credible sources.
- Zero plagiarism (confirmed by automated and manual checks).
- APA citations used consistently throughout.
- The paper must pass a peer-style academic review for accuracy.
- Content must remain aligned with the overall goal of exploring AI‑native software development.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All project activities must verify compliance with these principles.
